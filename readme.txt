== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do I have to do to get this thing to work? =

You must follow steps 1 through 3 in the installation section and then:
 In the Admin section create a new blank page.
 On the newly created page write `"__gs_mail_prog__"`
  (Copy and paste it from here if you like. Don't include the quotes.)
 Don't put anything else on this page.

= Suppose I want my important message/explanation/text on the email form page? =

No problem. Once you have activated the plugin there will be a
new item in your admin section down in 'Settings'. Click on 
G&S Header Mangement. Type your text there and it will appear on top
of the form.

= How do I see who signed up and get my CSV file? =
Click Settings in the Admin section. Click "G&S Email Management". 
You will see a list of the last 50 signups. You will also see a link
"Export list as a CSV file" that you can click to download the list
of all signups.

= Can I send the emails myself? =

Not at present. If there is sufficient interest we will add this
functionality.
